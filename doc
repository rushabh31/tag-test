AI-Driven Investigation Automation Framework: Architecture & Workflow

⸻

Overview

This solution automates and enhances risk or incident event investigations using a multi-agent AI system, combining LLM-based semantic reasoning with programmable data operations. The design ensures that investigation steps are explainable, repeatable, and efficient, with humans reviewing and approving the AI-generated plans before execution.

⸻

Architecture and Approach

Phases of Operation

Phase 1: AI-Assisted Investigation Plan Generation
	•	User Input: The process begins when a user reports a risk or incident event (e.g., misuse of an impersonation feature causing a financial loss).
	•	AI Planning: The system uses an LLM, guided by a curated prompt and referencing a knowledge base (business rules, system metadata, known patterns), to generate a step-by-step investigation plan. This plan:
	•	Specifies required data sources for each step.
	•	Outlines semantic and data operations (filtering, joining, aggregating, summarizing).
	•	Connects each step logically toward resolving the user’s query.
	•	Human-in-the-Loop: The user or investigator reviews, edits, and approves the generated plan.

Phase 2: Automated Semantic Execution Using AI Agents
	•	After approval, the investigation plan is executed step-by-step by a team of AI agents, each responsible for a specific function:
	•	SupervisorAgent: Orchestrates the workflow, delegates tasks, and maintains execution state.
	•	IOAgent: Fetches input data from files, databases, or APIs.
	•	SemanticAgent: Applies LLM-driven semantic reasoning for filtering, joining, aggregation, summarization, and semantic search.
	•	REPLAgent: Executes programmable, custom data logic (Python code) for transformations, statistical analysis, or advanced data manipulation.
	•	ReportAgent: Compiles and generates the final investigation report.

Agents and Their Responsibilities

Agent	Role
SupervisorAgent	Manages the investigation plan, workflow, and state. Delegates and sequences agent tasks.
IOAgent	Handles input operations—loads data from files, APIs, or databases.
SemanticAgent	Executes semantic/natural language operations: filtering, joining, extracting, aggregating, searching, ranking, and summarizing data.
REPLAgent	Executes custom Python code for data cleaning, transformation, complex joins, analytics, or visualizations. Works alongside SemanticAgent as needed.
ReportAgent	Generates the final, comprehensive investigation report from the results of all steps.

End-to-End Execution Flow (with Example)

Example Scenario

Event:
A developer utilized the FWS application’s “impersonation” feature (ID 123456), logged in as a trader, and accidentally cancelled a trade transaction worth $10MM.

Investigation Plan (Generated by LLM and Approved by User):
	1.	Review Operational Events data from ABC to find and understand the event.
	2.	Review BCD data for a list of applications with “impersonation” log-in feature and identify each application deployment status (production or development).
	3.	Review EFG entitlements data for each ID to identify the number of individuals with access to impersonation features and further understand the magnitude of the risk.
	4.	Verify each application status listed in ID with its respective active server location listed in GFT to identify the true application deployment status.
	5.	Review email from ORM Governance.
	6.	Review IST data to find the associated Issue and CAP to further understand the event and remediation plan.

⸻

Detailed Step-by-Step Execution with Agents

Step 1: Review Operational Events data from ABC
	•	IOAgent: Fetches ABC operational events data (from API, Excel, CSV, etc.).
	•	SemanticAgent: Filters for records relevant to the impersonation event.
	•	REPLAgent (if needed):
	•	Parses timestamps, aggregates by user/trader, computes statistics, or cleans/normalizes event logs.
	•	SupervisorAgent: Validates that the event has been fully captured; if not, requests additional data processing by REPLAgent.

⸻

Step 2: Review BCD data for impersonation apps and deployment status
	•	IOAgent: Loads BCD data listing all applications with the impersonation login feature.
	•	SemanticAgent: Extracts application list and deployment status.
	•	REPLAgent:
	•	Standardizes status fields (e.g., “prod” vs “production”).
	•	Cross-references with results from Step 1 to focus on impacted applications.
	•	Summarizes or flags status inconsistencies.
	•	SupervisorAgent: Confirms outputs meet the requirements.

⸻

Step 3: Review EFG entitlements data for access/risk analysis
	•	IOAgent: Fetches EFG entitlements data for all impersonation-enabled IDs.
	•	SemanticAgent: Identifies individuals with access to the impersonation feature.
	•	REPLAgent:
	•	Aggregates user access counts, produces summary statistics or risk rankings.
	•	Flags unusual or high-risk access patterns.
	•	Integrates with findings from previous steps.
	•	SupervisorAgent: Reviews for completeness and clarity.

⸻

Step 4: Verify application status in ID with active server location in GFT
	•	IOAgent: Loads application status (ID) and active server locations (GFT).
	•	SemanticAgent: Semantically matches application status with server location.
	•	REPLAgent:
	•	Performs detailed joins (e.g., fuzzy matching app names).
	•	Flags discrepancies (e.g., development apps running on production servers).
	•	Aggregates deployment info by environment.
	•	SupervisorAgent: Checks for mismatches and accuracy.

⸻

Step 5: Review email from ORM Governance
	•	IOAgent: Retrieves relevant ORM Governance emails.
	•	SemanticAgent: Performs semantic search for event-specific or governance-relevant emails.
	•	REPLAgent:
	•	Runs NLP code (keyword extraction, summarization, sentiment analysis).
	•	Highlights compliance, escalations, or governance actions.
	•	SupervisorAgent: Ensures extracted guidance is actionable and complete.

⸻

Step 6: Review IST data for associated Issue and CAP
	•	IOAgent: Loads IST data on issues and corrective action plans for implicated applications.
	•	SemanticAgent: Filters for relevant Issues and CAPs.
	•	REPLAgent:
	•	Analyzes CAPs for overdue/missing actions.
	•	Summarizes remediation timelines, owner assignments, and effectiveness.
	•	Correlates IST records with findings from earlier steps.
	•	SupervisorAgent: Validates remediation status and actionability.

⸻

Final Step: Report Generation
	•	ReportAgent: Compiles all results, findings, and analytics from the global state.
	•	REPLAgent (if needed):
	•	Generates visualizations, final data aggregations, or tabular summaries for the report.
	•	ReportAgent: Produces a comprehensive investigation report, ready for audit, review, or escalation.

⸻

Agent Interaction and Control Flow
	1.	SupervisorAgent orchestrates each step, monitors completion, and ensures correct sequencing.
	2.	For each step, IOAgent fetches required data, SemanticAgent applies LLM-powered logic, and REPLAgent handles any programmable or custom code needed for advanced processing.
	3.	If any step fails or results are insufficient, SupervisorAgent can:
	•	Trigger a retry,
	•	Request additional data transformation (via REPLAgent),
	•	Escalate to human review,
	•	Adjust the investigation plan with user input.
	4.	Once all steps are validated, ReportAgent finalizes the output.
